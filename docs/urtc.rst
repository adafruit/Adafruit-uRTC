DS1307
======

.. class:: DS1307(i2c, address=0x68)

    .. method:: datetime(datetime)

        Get or set the current time.

        The ``datetime`` is an 8-tuple of the format
        ``(year, month, day, weekday, hour, minute, second, millisecond)``
        describing the time to be set. If not specified, the method returns
        a tuple in the same format.


    .. method:: memory(address, buffer=None)

        Read or write the non-volatile random acces memory.

    .. method:: stop(value=None)

        Get or set the status of the stop clock flag. This can be used to start
        the clock at a precise moment in time.


DS3231
======

.. class:: DS3231(i2c, address=0x68)

    .. method:: datetime(datetime)

        Get or set the current time.

        The ``datetime`` is an 8-tuple of the format
        ``(year, month, day, weekday, hour, minute, second, millisecond)``
        describing the time to be set. If not specified, the method returns
        a tuple in the same format.

    .. method:: alarm_time(self, datetime=None, alarm=0)

        Get or set the alarm time.

        The ``datetime`` is a tuple in the same format as for ``datetime()``
        method.

        For alarm 1, only ``day``, ``hour``, ``minute`` and ``weekday`` values
        are used, the rest is ignored. Alarm 0 additionally supports seconds.

    .. method:: lost_power()

        Return ``True`` if the clock lost the power recently and needs to be
        re-set.

    .. method:: alarm(value=None, alarm=0)

        Get or set the value of the alarm flag. This is set to ``True`` when
        an alarm is triggered, and has to be cleared manually.

    .. method:: interrupt(alarm=0)

        Configure the INT/SQW pin to be activated when an alarm occurs.

        it from a power down (sleep) mode.

    .. method:: no_interrupt()

        Disable activation of the INT/SQW pin when an alarm occurs. This
        disables both alarm 0 and alarm 1.

    .. method:: stop(value=None)

        Get or set the status of the stop clock flag. This can be used to start
        the clock at a precise moment in time.
