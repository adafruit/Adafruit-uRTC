DEPRECATED LIBRARY
==================

This library has been deprecated! We are leaving this up for historical and research purposes but archiving the repository.

We are now only supporting the use of our CircuitPython libraries for use with Python.

Please see the documentation on RTC in CircuitPython: https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared-bindings/rtc/RTC.html

There are CircuitPython libraries specific to RTC modules, such as https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DS1307 etc. Check out the search on the [Adafruit Learn System](https://learn.adafruit.com/) for more information.
